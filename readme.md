##FurrFace

FurrFace is a social networking website that allows users to create profiles for their pets, upload photos, send messages and keep in touch with friends and family. Users can sort pets by Top Fuzzies (most likes), find pets in their neighborhood, find similar pets, and set up playdates for thier pets using a message board. I worked on a team consisting of Java developers and Front End developers to create this website.
